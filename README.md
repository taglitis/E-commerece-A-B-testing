Based on the provided dataset the hypothesis test has been completed to define either a new page or an old one is better. So, from the obtained evidenes we rejected a new page and kept the old one: **The P-value was computed. It is a probability of obtaining our data from the Null hypothysis given that H0 is true. Because the p-values is significantly large and, therefore, it is larger than  alpha=0.05  we have evidance that with type I error rate 5% that a new page is not better than old one.**

Secondly, we completed the Logistic regression where we supported our results using the mulitplicative coefficient for ab_page dummy variable as well as using its p-value.

Thirdly, three countries were added to the Logistic regression and we obtain multiplicative coefficients for them as well, along with ab_page coefficeint.

Finally, we can say that there is not only an absence of statistical sagnificance to use a new page, but also the practical sagnificance is not presented due to the expences which might occur due to the creation of the web-site, developing its new SEO and other promotion on the net.
